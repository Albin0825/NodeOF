Clone the repository: The first step is to clone the repository that contains the package you want to install. To do this, open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to install the package. Then, use the command git clone https://github.com/[username]/[repository-name].git to clone the repository to your local machine. This will create a new directory with the same name as the repository in your current directory.

Navigate to the cloned repository: After the repository has been cloned, navigate to the root of the cloned repository using the command cd [repository-name]. This will change the current working directory to the root of the cloned repository.

Install dependencies: The next step is to install the dependencies of the package. Most Node.js packages have a file called package.json that lists all the dependencies of the package. To install these dependencies, use the command npm install. This will download and install all the necessary packages to the node_modules directory within the repository.

Build the package: Some packages may require additional steps such as building before it can be used. You can check the package documentation for more information. If the package requires building, use the command npm run build to build the package.

Link the package: After the package has been built, you can link it to your global Node.js modules using the command npm link. This will create a symlink from the package in the node_modules directory to the global modules directory, making it available for use in any project.

Test the package: Before using the package in a project, it's a good idea to test it to make sure it works as expected. You can do this by running the command npm test.

Use the package: Finally, you can use the package in your project by requiring it as a dependency. To do this, simply add the package name to the dependencies section of your project's package.json file and run npm install.
